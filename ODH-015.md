# Overview of Documentation Community Hour[ODH-015]: Documentation as Code

## Introduction

Many of us in tech have experienced the challenge of writing both code and documentation, often favoring code over documentation. The philosophy of Documentation as Code, more commonly known as _**Docs as Code**_, bridges this gap by treating documentation with the similar tools, processes, and respect as source code. In this session, Robert Krátký explains how this approach streamlines documentation development by integrating it closely with source code in software projects.

## What is *Docs as Code*?

*Docs as Code* is an approach that treats documentation as a first-class citizen alongside software source code. Instead of favoring code, it places documentation on equal footing in the software development lifecycle.

This approach avoids reliance on a single monolithic system, it leverages specialized tools throughout the content creation, review, and publishing process. Often, the choice of tools aligns with the specific software process it addresses.

## Workflow

One of the core objectives of the *Docs as Code* approach is to promote using the most suitable tools for each documentation task. As the saying goes, 'If your only tool is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.' Understanding the purpose and selecting the right tools leads to more effective and valuable documentation.

We can further understand this through the typical lifecycle of documentation when it is maintained as code.

| Goals                | Tools                                      | Reasoning                                          		      |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Content Authoring    | Text Editors                              | Use non-binary, human-readable formats 			|
| Formatting & Styling | Markup Languages                          | Semantic formatting with stylesheets enables multiple output formats (HTML, PDF) |
| Version Control      | Git, SVN, Mercurial                       | Essential for tracking changes and history       					|
| Issue Tracking       | JIRA, Bugzilla, Mantis                    | Manage bugs and improvements                      |
| Testing & Validation | Scripts, Linters, Spell Checkers          | Borrow software testing concepts to ensure quality and reusability |
| Publishing           | Static Site Generators, CMS               | Automated hosting and updates                      |

### The Good

In the *Docs as Code* approach:

- Documentation tools support automated processes like change tracking, testing, and publishing via static site generators or content management systems ensuring high quality and seamless updates.
  
- Version control of documentation provides:
  - Parallel updates and easier collaboration.
  - Detailed change tracking that clearly matches modifications to their authors.
  - Improved transparency, flexibility, and maintainability across the project.
    
- It streamlines the integration and maintenance of documentation alongside code, for example:
	- Completion of functional documentation hand in hand with software development, synchronized with key project milestones such as software release.
	- Peer document reviews tied closely with code reviews.
	- Accurate document-to-code version alignment, keeping docs synced with the corresponding code on each individual software release branch.
   
- The core tools used are typically open-source and portable, rather than proprietary solutions (e.g., Adobe FrameMaker, MadCap, or RoboHelp). This avoids vendor lock-in, preventing dependency on a single vendor’s ecosystem that complicates switching or migration.
  
- Developers already know these tools- including IDEs, text editors, and scripting tools- making it more natural for them to contribute to documentation, fostering stronger collaboration.

### The Bad and the Ugly

- Writers may face a steep learning curve adapting to markup languages and distributed tooling.
- Developers might resist added documentation responsibilities.
- Switching markup dialects (e.g., Markdown to reStructuredText) can be cumbersome.
- Finding user-friendly tools for build and integration is often difficult.
- Transitioning workflows may cause temporary release disruptions.

### Practical Tips

- Use portable and familiar editors for collaboration.
- Keep documentation in a version control system for easy tracking.
- Automated tests and checks can help catch discrepancies early, to the point of preventing release of incorrect software by identifying outdated docs.
